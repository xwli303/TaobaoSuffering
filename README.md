# TaobaoSuffering
A project inspired by my first capstone.
This is a simple tool that is meant to facilitate shopping experiences on Chinese and Japanese shopping sites for me and my friends.
The program converts a few units between the metric and the imperial system (cm to in, kg to lb), I chose these units because they are most commonly used in clothes measurements,
I will add additional units if I encounter them in future shopping experience.
--to be done: a calculator
--to be done: currency converters between USD and JPY, USD and CNY.
